Exposed Services
Nmap scan results for each machine reveal the below services and OS details:
nmap-sV-O-vv192.168.1.110

This scan identifies the services below as potential points of entry:
Target 1
Port22/tcp-ssh-open
Port80/tcp-http-open
Port111/tcp-rcbind-open
Port139/tcp-netbois-ssn-open
Port445/tcp-netbios-ssn-open

Port 22
An open port 22 can allow ssh logins. Keeps port 22 open and usally welcomes attackers to brute force using a dictionary attack

Port 80
Port 80 allows for HTTP traffic. Attackers can also use brute force and dictionary attacks to gain access.


Port 111
Port 111 allows attackers to see what services are running. This can be used for reconnaissance activity. The RPC Service has a history of security vulnerabilities.

Port 139 & 445
These ports allow for network file sharing. Also allow the potential of a possible reverse shell via Metasploit.
